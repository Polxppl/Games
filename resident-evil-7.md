Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom in 2017. The game marks a return to the series' roots with a greater emphasis on atmosphere, exploration, and puzzle-solving, diverging from the action-heavy approach of previous installments. Set in the haunting Louisiana countryside, the story unfolds through the perspective of Ethan Winters, a civilian searching for his missing wife, Mia. The change to a first-person perspective enhances the sense of immersion and terror, making every encounter with danger feel intensely personal.

The game introduces players to the horrifying Baker family, who are infected by a mysterious bioweapon. Their decrepit plantation serves as the primary setting, an intricately designed labyrinth of decaying rooms, hidden passages, and grotesque surprises. The Bakers' home feels alive with dread, its every creak and shadow capable of masking a lurking threat. The oppressive atmosphere, combined with limited resources and scarce ammunition, intensifies the survival horror experience, forcing players to think carefully about every decision.

Gameplay in Resident Evil 7 is a blend of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. Ethan must search for keys, solve environmental riddles, and confront monstrous creatures known as the Molded, all while unraveling the mystery of the Bakers and the sinister organization behind the events. Weapons and healing items are in short supply, adding tension to every encounter. The game’s save system and inventory management harken back to classic Resident Evil titles, creating a deliberate and suspenseful pace.

The narrative delves deep into psychological horror, blending personal tragedy with bio-terrorism. Ethan’s relationship with Mia adds an emotional weight to the story, as players grapple with trust and betrayal in the face of unimaginable horrors. Meanwhile, the overarching narrative ties back to the larger Resident Evil universe, linking Ethan’s ordeal to the series' long-running mythology. The introduction of the bioweapon Eveline and her mind-controlling abilities provides a chilling new layer to the series’ lore.

Visually and aurally, Resident Evil 7 excels in creating a sense of unease. The game’s photorealistic graphics and intricate sound design work in tandem to craft a world dripping with fear. From the grotesque details of the Baker family’s grotesque dining table to the eerie silence of the swamp, every element of the presentation is meticulously crafted. With its gripping story, atmospheric setting, and terrifying gameplay, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard revitalized the series and cemented its place as one of the most terrifying entries in the franchise.
